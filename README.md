I am currently Getting Started with Python Programming.

Python is a high level portable, platform independent, object oriented , dynamically typed and interpreted programming language.

High level means human easily understandable code, Human readable format.

Portable can be transported easily or moved from one place to other place easily.

Platform independent means the python code can run in any operating system.

Object oriented concepts can be used.

Dynamically typed means it does not require data types to be typed the interpreter can understand the datatype.

Interpreted means the code will run line by line.
